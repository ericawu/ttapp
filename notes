Things to do:
    Profile page with id:
        /profile/769108475
        - Show/hide buttons based on current user matching profile id

    Match information page
        /match/27348572083

    Profile first/last name setup upon registration
    -Only can make an account if you're part of pga? Idk if that can work

    -Error message if image doesn't upload correctly
	-Loading animation when uploading picture? It takes a long time
	-Stats like win %, lose % (Microsoft's PowerBI would be perfect if we can embed)
	-Separated player profile page for personal profile page you can edit and public page

	-Picture slideshow! Makes the front page more interesting. Let ppl upload pics of themselves/friends playing and display them on main landing page.
		-Make new container in azure
		-Know which container you're uploading to in .js 
		-Make new images collection, store url's in there and iterate through on main page
		-Add and delete functionality from profile page? So only can add if you're logged in


	-Make site more colorful (Microsoft likes colors) (low priority)


Things to fix:
    - Current matches highlights greater points even if game is not finished
    - Clicking a link does not reset the link color after clicking
	-Fix edit username button alignment
