Things to do:
    - Match information page: /match/27348572083

    Profile first/last name setup upon registration
    - Only can make an account if you're part of pga? Idk if that can work

    - Error message if image doesn't upload correctly
	- Loading animation when uploading picture? It takes a long time
	- Stats like win %, lose % (Microsoft's PowerBI would be perfect if we can embed)

	- Picture slideshow! Makes the front page more interesting. Let ppl upload pics of themselves/friends playing and display them on main landing page.
		- Make new container in azure
		- Know which container you're uploading to in .js 
		- Make new images collection, store url's in there and iterate through on main page
		- Add and delete functionality from profile page? So only can add if you're logged in

	- Make site more colorful (Microsoft likes colors) (low priority)

    - Add search feature to players and matches page
    - Standardize newmatch/editmatch/view match into one page
    - Add optional categories like hometown, age, etc. to profile page

Things to fix:
    - Sometimes a new game will be added in the match display (after game is finished)
